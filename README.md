# Grocery Expiry Manager

This quarantine really messed up my grocery management as I was constantly running into situations where the stuff in the fridge went past expiry date. Now I know there are apps out there which are far more efficient and good looking than mine which do exactly the same thing, but I took up the free time to learn the MERN stack and develop a working web application which keeps track of the expiry date of all the items you enter during the time of purchase. You can get this app started in under 10 minutes and use it for your own grocery management. This can also be easily used as a to-do list with a deadline.

## Setting up the database
1. You would want to setup a MongoDB account. Go through this video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuCrHynro0w&list=PLurIMwd6GdCj_VlnKVceR66Sxfcb37VU8&index=4&t=0s">5:01</a>.
2. Open config\keys.js file and enter your username, password and the database name you want.

## Instructions to Run
1. Clone the repo and run `npm install` which will install all the node modules. Do the same in client folder for the react app node modules.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start both the server and client
